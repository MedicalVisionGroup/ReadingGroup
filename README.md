Kayhan and I (George) will talk about a new approach to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that is NOT based on iterative hill-climbing type algorithms that may only reach a local optima; instead, under a separability assumption which is empirically observed in real topic modeling data, NMF for learning topic models can be solved in polynomial time. The paper that we’ll look at is on arXiv, and we’ll focus on everything up to and including Section 3.1 (mid way through page 8–basically we’ll focus on the case where there are true anchor words):

Mar 20
We will read Dan Feldman’s NIPS paper. Here’s an updated PDF that includes supplemental material: nips11coresets-supplemental.pdf

Here’s the NIPS talk: http://videolectures.net/nips2011_faulkner_coresets/

Update (3/19/2012, 10:17pm) Preliminary notes that I (George) typed up for last week’s discussion are here: reading_group_2012_03_13_notes.pdf Unfortunately, from what I can tell, some constants from the lecture notes don’t quite match constants in literature cited at times. I tried to reconcile these discrepancies. The main message is *not* any different though; basically the k-center coreset construction algorithm has a horrendous running time in terms of the number of clusters k.

Mar 13
We will finish reading the survey paper from last week, emphasizing clustering (section 6) and the high-dimensional setting (section 7).

Update (3/13/2012, 2:34am) Preliminary notes that I (George) typed up for last week’s discussion are here: reading_group_2012_03_06_notes.pdf Unfortunately, these may not be terribly helpful for this week’s reading as the clustering material is quite different...

Mar 6
In preparation for Dan Feldman’s coresets talk in April, we’ll be reading a (dated) survey on the basics of coresets from computational geometry. Basically the idea is that we want to approximate some interesting metric of a bunch of data points by using a hopefully substantially smaller subsample (called a coreset) of the data points. The reading:

P.K. Agarwal, S. Har-Peled, and K.R. Varadarajan. “Geometric Approximation via Coresets”. (2005) coresets_survey_2005.pdf

As a preview for what’s to come, here’s Dan’s paper at NIPS 2011 on how to build a coreset for a (huge) training dataset of a mixture model while retaining an $\epsilon$-approximation to the data likelihood; the result is that you can run, say, the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models on the coreset instead (this is NOT part of the reading for Mar 6 although I’d recommend looking over the abstract to see what coresets can achieve now):

D. Feldman, M. Faulkner, and A. Krause. “Scalabe Training of Mixture Models via Coresets”. (2011) coresets_nips11.pdf

Feb 28
We’ll be reading a paper on a model and algorithm for Gaussian process classification:

Urtasun, R. and Darrell, T.: Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model for Classification. ICML ‘07

urtasun-icml-gaussian-process-classification.pdf

Feb 21
We will read Mackay’s tutorial on Gaussian processes: mackay-gaussian-processes.pdf

Thanks to Iman for finding an updated version: mackay-gaussian-processes-frombook.pdf

We’ll focus on the first 6 sections.

Another useful reference is Williams’ tutorial: williams-gaussian-process.pdf (only Sections 3 and 4 are relevant to this week’s discussion).

Feb 14
We will read the first 4 sections of “A Riemannian Framework for Tensor Computing” riemannian_framework_for_tensor_computing_2005.pdf.

Jan 31
We will be reading the paper “Smooth relevance vector machine: a smoothness prior extension of the RVM” by Alexander Schmolck and Richard Everson (Mach Learn (2007) 68: 107–135) smoothrvm.pdf

We’ll discuss and compare it to papers we covered earlier, Mert’s MICCAI sabuncumiccai2011.pdf and journal paper (coming soon) as well as Tipping’s original work on RVM tippingjmlr2001_sparsebayesianlearningandtherelevancevectormachine.pdf.

Jan 17
UPDATE: Annotations added. I recommend reading most of the introduction for context and background, so I’ve left it without annotations. In the Methods section, I’ve highlighted titles of subsections that are pertinent to the results I intend to cover. Similarly, in the Results section, I’ve highlighted subsections I intend to cover and struck through everything we won’t discuss. Despite this, there is still a fairly large amount of text to read, some of which is somewhat technical (in a neuroscientific sense). Therefore, I recommend initially focusing on the results figures, which are highly illustrative and well described in their respective captions, then referring back to the text.

Annotated PDF: j_neurophys-2011-yeo-annot-print.pdf

We plan to read parts of Thomas’ (and others’) paper on a large scale study of resting state functional connectivity in healthy subjects. The discussion should mostly be centred around particularly interesting results that could serve as motivation for future work in our group. Once I’ve read all of the paper in detail, I’ll try to narrow down the results sections so that the amount of material is reasonable.

B. T. Thomas Yeo, Fenna M. Krienen, Jorge Sepulcre, Mert R. Sabuncu, Danial Lashkari, Marisa Hollinshead, Joshua L. Roffman, Jordan W. Smoller, Lilla Zöllei, Jonathan R.

Fall 2011
Dec 7
met-mlbayes.pdf We’re going back in time and covering a tutorial in Bayesian inference in Machine Learning by Tipping. It offers a nice build-up from least squares regression to the RVM. The Models in Section 4 are very related to the RVoxM readings from the previous 2 weeks.

rvmpath.pdf I put together a quick list of papers and references for learning the RVM and RVoxM. If you are interested in this topic, take a look at the file for more information/paths to take.

For the curios, heretipping.pdf‘s some results from a quick (potentially buggy) implementation. I tried to keep the colors as those Tipping’s Figure 5, although I had to guess some of the parameters so the curves are slightly different. The new blue line shows the (-log) joint that we were wondering about, and the red is the (-log) marginal likelihood from the paper (these later two curves were rescaled). Although they differ slightly, all three estimations of lambda (validation, joint, marginal) seem ~equally decent.

Dec 1
Note special time this week: Thursday, Dec 1, 4pm
We’ll go into the hyperparameter estimation derivations from the Relevance Voxel Machine. I’ve emailed a draft of the journal RVoxM paper to V-Golland. We will concentrate on Sections II, III and VI (Theory and Appendix).

For the interested, more reading into RVM:

Michel Tipping maintains a website on “Sparse Bayesian Models (& the RVM)”: http://www.miketipping.com/index.php?page=rvm
One of the papers, “Sparse Bayesian learning and the relevance vector machine” tipping01a.pdf has relevant derivations in sec 1, 2, 5. (see http://www.miketipping.com/index.php?page=corrections for corrections)
Fletcher fletcher_-_rvm_explained.pdf also dives right into the theory (much less discussion on motivation/application/etc)
See 2004-wipf-ieeesigproc.pdf for another perspective on sparsity

Nov 22
Note special time this week: Tuesday, Nov 22, 4pm

We’ll be reading Mert’s MICCAI paper - Sabuncu and Leemput, The Relevance Voxel Machine (RVoxM): A Bayesian Method for Image-based Prediction, MICCAI, 2011 - sabuncumiccai2011.pdf

Nov 16
We will read “Connectivity-Informed fMRI Activation Detection” by Bernard Ng, Rafeef Abugharbieh, Gael Varoquaux, Jean Baptiste Poline and Bertrand Thirion. ng_connectivityinformedfmri_miccai11.pdf

Nov 2 and 9
We’ll read up on RKHSs. We’ll start with this tutorial: daume04rkhs.pdf Sections 1-5 are straightforward and should be mostly review, so we’ll just be discussing Section 6. There are a few typos:

At the end of 6.2, the first sentence of the last paragraph is more clear as “The property of reproducing kernels that we need is <f,K(x,\cdot)> = f(\cdot).”

The right-hand side of the equation in 6.4.1 should read $\lambda\phi(x)$ (instead of x^\prime).

The notes that George posted are also relevant; here are the notes and the blurb: On an unrelated note, here are some notes I hacked up about basics of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and Kernel Ridge Regression: reading_group_prep_rkhs_2011_10_14.pdf This is NOT related to the 10/19 reading; it’s related to the 10/12 reading. This could be useful for when we return to talking about kernel methods. Update 10/13: A few minor typos have been corrected. Update 10/14: The proof for the closed-form solution for kernel ridge regression has been extended to allow for possibly non-invertible kernel matrices.

Oct 26
We will go through the details of INLA and discuss applications. Please read Section 4 in addition to the first part of the paper.

Here’s a write-up on the Laplace’s approximation from 6.437: laplace.pdf

Oct 19
We will read about integrated nested Laplace approximations (it’s a 74-page beast, but references begin on page 32 followed by discussions that happened after publication): Håvard Rue, Sara Martino, and Nicolas Chopin. “Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations.” JRSS 2009. inla.pdf

Update 10/18: Just read through the end of section 3; this amounts to ~13.3 pages of reading.
Update 10/19 1:38am: Notes I (George) will use today at reading group. It’s high-level and almost surely has bugs: reading_group_inla_notes_2011_10_19_0137.pdf

July 26
We will continue covering Wainwright’s notes on sparse linear models (i.e. same reading as July 12 and 19). In particular, we will blow up the plot on Page 92, work through the proof for Theorem 5.3 and Example 5.7, and finish discussion about pairwise incoherence and the restricted isometry property (RIP). As an illustrative example, I (George) will also discuss Exercise 5.2 at the end of the chapter (showing that pairwise incoherence implies the restricted nullspace property, without using RIP results). Non-trivial probabilistic results that are used in Example 5.7 and Exercise 5.2c will be briefly discussed.

Definition 5.3. and Theorem 5.3 are in hard-to-read shaded boxes, which are reproduced here: reading_group_july_26.pdf

July 12
We will cover Martin Wainwright’s notes on sparse linear models up to and including section 5.3.2.

Discussion

Mar 14
We’ll look at “Fitting a graph to vector data” fitting_a_graph_to_vector_data.pdf, which gives an alternate approach to K-nearest neighbors and epsilon radius for creating the initial graph.

Feb 28 (no meeting on Feb 21 -- Presidents' Day)
We will look more closely at the derivation that leads to the eigenvector problem in one of the references in the paper we read last time. Specifically, we will discuss theorems 14.2.1 and 14.4.2 in Multivariate Analysis by Mardia, Kent and Bibby. multivariate_analysis.pdf

Proof that the SVD is the best low rank approximation and the exercise in Mardia svdproof.pdf

Remark: Given the discussion during reading group, it seems that a Cholesky decomposition would work. In particular, for real, positive semi-definite B, using Cholesky decomposition would produce lower-triangular, real-valued L such that:

B = L * L^T

As an example, if B is full-rank, then the columns of L would all be independent forming a basis (which may not be orthonormal; although we could say that the original data points also need not be orthonormal).

More information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition#Statement

Feb 14
Actually, we will discuss Tenebaum, J.B., de Silva, V., and Langford, J.C., A global geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, Science, 290, p 2319-2323, 2000. isomap.pdf

J. Shi, J. Malik: Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation shimalik-normalizedcuts.pdf

We’ll mainly be focusing on section 2 - i.e. why it is that minimizing the normalized cut turns out to be a generalized eigenvalue problem.

We might also want to discuss how we can interpret this by forming a Markov chain on the graph, so I’ve added a relevant paper meila-aistats-2001.pdf.

Jan 25
We’ll be continuing Sharpnack’s paper on graph labeling, focusing on Theorem 1 and its proof:

J. Sharpnack, A. Singh; Identifying graph-structured activation patterns in networks sharpnack-graph-nips10.pdf

A video of the conference talk is here: http://videolectures.net/nips2010_sharpnack_igs/ (the talk doesn’t go into detail on the proofs, but does give a little bit of intuition for the terms in the theorem).

We’ll also look briefly at these papers on other spectral methods: shimalik-normalizedcuts.pdf ng-spectralclustering.pdf belkin-laplacianeigenmaps.pdf

Fall 2010
Dec 2
We will clean up our discussion of the demons algorithms. The leftover items is the second-order optimization and the relationship between regularization and smoothing.

1) For the ESM method, we will look at section 3 of this paper:

We will continue our asymptotic quest. Let’s hope this process converges to the true value of the parameters!

Here is my last version of summary: Reading: summarydoob.pdf

October 31
We will continue the discussion of Wilks’ paper on the asymptotics of LR. In order to make sense of the main assumption of equation (3), we have to go through the reference to Doob’s paper which is a seminal derivation of many basic theorems.

Papoulis (pp. 275–278) is a good introductory note on asymptotics of hypothesis testing (photocopies outside Polina’s office). See also his statistics chapter (pp. 241–282) for hypothesis testing in general. The original papers for the asymptotics of the likelihood ratio are:

wald1943.pdf

chernoff1954.pdf

September 19
We will continue the paper from last week.

We also made a note that we need to look into asympotic statistics results (mentioned in the paper) in the future. Kinh might take a lead on that.

Here’s the original DCM paper, for people who want more detail:

Note the special time: 4pm

We will continue our discussion on effective connectivity in neuroimaging. We will focus on the second half of the first paper from last time (Friston 1994). If time is allowed, we will discuss the third paper from last time as well (Friston 1997).

August 29
We will discuss functional and effective connectivity in neuroimaging. The first paper is the most general paper. The second paper is a book chapter version of the first paper on functional connectivity and goes a bit deeper. The third paper deals with more exotic topic in effective connectivity. We will mainly discuss the first paper, so if you have limited time, the first one is the paper to read.

August 22
We will start the meetings with two papers that Wanmei claims use the same model in two somewhat unrelated applications. Both papers consider the fundamental problem of evidence integration from independent sources.

We will discuss the details of the models and the relationship between them. If you have time to read just one paper, the first one is lighter.

We will discuss ICA for fMRI time series analysis. The longer paper discusses the method in details, and will be the basis for our discussion. The shorter one is a nice overview.

We will discuss the Dirichlet process mixture model, as presented in Teh 04, , which develops a variant of the DP mixture for grouped data. Other papers (all cited by Teh) are provided here for those interested in a deeper theoretical background: Ferguson 73 and Antoniak 74 are the seminal papers (with fairly technical measure-theoretic proofs), while Sethuraman 94, followed by Ishwaran and James 01 and Ishwaran and Zarepour 02, are more constructive. Of these, I’d recommend Sethuraman for clarity and brevity. – John

I (Thomas) will be presenting the papers for this week.

Andrew Ng Michael Jordan and Yair Weiss
On Spectral Clustering: An analysis and an algorithm
ng-spectralclustering.pdf

Optional Papers: I will talk about mixture fitting, but I will not be completely following Michael Collins’ derivations. However, the tutorial is still nice if you have no experience with mixture fitting or EM. We will NOT go over the theorems about convergence, i.e. we will not go beyond section 3.3. The idea is to give everyone an intuitive feel about the concept of mixture fitting, not limiting oneself to using only gaussians or the EM technique.

I think it might be worth switching to one of the pFDR papers for the extensions of the FDR. I’m reading through some of them, and will post suggestions if one of them strikes me. In particular, I think they have a nicer treatment of independence, and it will be nice to see some other approaches to FDR. -Ray
